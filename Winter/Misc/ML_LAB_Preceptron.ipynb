    "2. Implement an activation function\n",
    "3. Implement an update function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialize a weight vector\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the dimensionality of this vector?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first think through the dimensionality of our weight vector. How many entries should it have? Recall that the sum $h$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h = \\sum_{i=1}^{m}w_i x_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w_i$ is the $i^{th}$ entry of the weight vector $\\vec{w}$ and $x_i$ is the $i^{th}$ entry of the input vector $\\vec{x}$. This means that for every input value we will need a weight value that goes with it. In another word, if there are $n$ entries in our input vector $\\vec{x}$, we will need a weight vector $\\vec{w}$ of length $n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we want to include an additional bias node in our model where the input is always a non-zero value. Since we will be alterning the weight $w_b$ associated with the bias node at the same time as all other nodes in our network, it might be convinient to dedicate a spot in our weight vector $\\vec{w}$ that represents the weight $w_0$. Thus, for a problem with $n$ inputs, $\\vec{w}$ might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{w}^T = [w_0, w_1, w_2, ..., w_n]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $\\vec{w}$ has a length of $n+1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What initial value do we assign the vector?\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial value we assign the entries in our weight vector $\\vec{w}$ matters. If we assign very large values, then $h$ will also be a very large value regardless of our input values (given that input values are not all zeros). If we assign extremely small values, we run into the opposite problem, where $h$ will also be a extremely small value regardless of the input values. We also want to avoid initializing it with all zeros. If you're interested in understanding why, please take a look at this [stackexcahnge response](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/26134/initialize-perceptron-weights-with-zero) that gives a concise explanation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, it is ideal to have weights that are neither too big or too small. For neural networks (which we will get to soon), The last desired quaility in our initialization values would be non-uniformity. We don't want to assign a single value across the board, and the way to achieve this is by using pseudorandom generators. "
